        <div class="bookwriting"> <p>Kelsey Day’s sophomore poetry book, rootlines, is a visceral collection about hope during the apocalypse. It blurs the lines between the human and non-human world, colonial perceptions of “nature,” and pays testimony to the Appalachian mountains that have long been abused by the fossil fuel industry. Both literary and accessible, this is a collection about place, risk, and grief – about the roots we grow from and the branches we reach with.</p> <p>These are poems grounded in place; it is therefore essential to recognize that southern Appalachia as we know it today was built on stolen land.

All pre-ordered copies will be distributed directly by me, not through Wilde Press, and all the profits will go directly to the Indigenous Environmental Network.</p>
